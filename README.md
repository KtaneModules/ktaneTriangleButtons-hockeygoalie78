Module is fully playable and available on Steam at https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1743336819
If any other mod developers would like to add Rule Seed support, Twitch Plays support, etc. please contact me on discord.
If this repository has an "original" branch, it is the project I developed myself rather than the master branch.
